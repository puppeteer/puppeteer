<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export namespace Protocol 
```

## Namespaces

|  Namespace | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Accessibility](./puppeteer.protocol.accessibility.md) |  |
|  [Animation](./puppeteer.protocol.animation.md) |  |
|  [ApplicationCache](./puppeteer.protocol.applicationcache.md) |  |
|  [Audits](./puppeteer.protocol.audits.md) | Audits domain allows investigation of page violations and possible improvements. |
|  [BackgroundService](./puppeteer.protocol.backgroundservice.md) | Defines events for background web platform features. |
|  [Browser](./puppeteer.protocol.browser.md) | The Browser domain defines methods and events for browser managing. |
|  [CacheStorage](./puppeteer.protocol.cachestorage.md) |  |
|  [Cast](./puppeteer.protocol.cast.md) | A domain for interacting with Cast, Presentation API, and Remote Playback API functionalities. |
|  [Console](./puppeteer.protocol.console.md) | This domain is deprecated - use Runtime or Log instead. |
|  [CSS](./puppeteer.protocol.css.md) | This domain exposes CSS read/write operations. All CSS objects (stylesheets, rules, and styles) have an associated <code>id</code> used in subsequent operations on the related object. Each object type has a specific <code>id</code> structure, and those are not interchangeable between objects of different kinds. CSS objects can be loaded using the <code>get*ForNode()</code> calls (which accept a DOM node id). A client can also keep track of stylesheets via the <code>styleSheetAdded</code>/<code>styleSheetRemoved</code> events and subsequently load the required stylesheet contents using the <code>getStyleSheet[Text]()</code> methods. |
|  [Database](./puppeteer.protocol.database.md) |  |
|  [Debugger](./puppeteer.protocol.debugger.md) | Debugger domain exposes JavaScript debugging capabilities. It allows setting and removing breakpoints, stepping through execution, exploring stack traces, etc. |
|  [DeviceOrientation](./puppeteer.protocol.deviceorientation.md) |  |
|  [DOM](./puppeteer.protocol.dom.md) | This domain exposes DOM read/write operations. Each DOM Node is represented with its mirror object that has an <code>id</code>. This <code>id</code> can be used to get additional information on the Node, resolve it into the JavaScript object wrapper, etc. It is important that client receives DOM events only for the nodes that are known to the client. Backend keeps track of the nodes that were sent to the client and never sends the same node twice. It is client's responsibility to collect information about the nodes that were sent to the client.<p>Note that <code>iframe</code> owner elements will return corresponding document elements as their child nodes.</p> |
|  [DOMDebugger](./puppeteer.protocol.domdebugger.md) | DOM debugging allows setting breakpoints on particular DOM operations and events. JavaScript execution will stop on these operations as if there was a regular breakpoint set. |
|  [DOMSnapshot](./puppeteer.protocol.domsnapshot.md) | This domain facilitates obtaining document snapshots with DOM, layout, and style information. |
|  [DOMStorage](./puppeteer.protocol.domstorage.md) | Query and modify DOM storage. |
|  [Emulation](./puppeteer.protocol.emulation.md) | This domain emulates different environments for the page. |
|  [Fetch](./puppeteer.protocol.fetch.md) | A domain for letting clients substitute browser's network layer with client code. |
|  [HeadlessExperimental](./puppeteer.protocol.headlessexperimental.md) | This domain provides experimental commands only supported in headless mode. |
|  [HeapProfiler](./puppeteer.protocol.heapprofiler.md) |  |
|  [IndexedDB](./puppeteer.protocol.indexeddb.md) |  |
|  [Input](./puppeteer.protocol.input.md) |  |
|  [Inspector](./puppeteer.protocol.inspector.md) |  |
|  [IO](./puppeteer.protocol.io.md) | Input/Output operations for streams produced by DevTools. |
|  [LayerTree](./puppeteer.protocol.layertree.md) |  |
|  [Log](./puppeteer.protocol.log.md) | Provides access to log entries. |
|  [Media](./puppeteer.protocol.media.md) | This domain allows detailed inspection of media elements |
|  [Memory](./puppeteer.protocol.memory.md) |  |
|  [Network](./puppeteer.protocol.network.md) | Network domain allows tracking network activities of the page. It exposes information about http, file, data and other requests and responses, their headers, bodies, timing, etc. |
|  [Overlay](./puppeteer.protocol.overlay.md) | This domain provides various functionality related to drawing atop the inspected page. |
|  [Page](./puppeteer.protocol.page.md) | Actions and events related to the inspected page belong to the page domain. |
|  [Performance](./puppeteer.protocol.performance.md) |  |
|  [Profiler](./puppeteer.protocol.profiler.md) |  |
|  [Runtime](./puppeteer.protocol.runtime.md) | Runtime domain exposes JavaScript runtime by means of remote evaluation and mirror objects. Evaluation results are returned as mirror object that expose object type, string representation and unique identifier that can be used for further object reference. Original objects are maintained in memory unless they are either explicitly released or are released along with the other objects in their object group. |
|  [Schema](./puppeteer.protocol.schema.md) | This domain is deprecated. |
|  [Security](./puppeteer.protocol.security.md) | Security |
|  [ServiceWorker](./puppeteer.protocol.serviceworker.md) |  |
|  [Storage](./puppeteer.protocol.storage.md) |  |
|  [SystemInfo](./puppeteer.protocol.systeminfo.md) | The SystemInfo domain defines methods and events for querying low-level system information. |
|  [Target](./puppeteer.protocol.target.md) | Supports additional targets discovery and allows to attach to them. |
|  [Tethering](./puppeteer.protocol.tethering.md) | The Tethering domain defines methods and events for browser port binding. |
|  [Tracing](./puppeteer.protocol.tracing.md) |  |
|  [WebAudio](./puppeteer.protocol.webaudio.md) | This domain allows inspection of Web Audio API. https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/ |
|  [WebAuthn](./puppeteer.protocol.webauthn.md) | This domain allows configuring virtual authenticators to test the WebAuthn API. |
