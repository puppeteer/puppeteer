## Coverage class

The Coverage class provides methods to gathers information about parts of JavaScript and CSS that were used by the page.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Coverage 
```

## Remarks

To output coverage in a form consumable by [Istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs), see [puppeteer-to-istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/puppeteer-to-istanbul).

## Example

An example of using JavaScript and CSS coverage to get percentage of initially executed code:

```js
// Enable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
await Promise.all([
  page.coverage.startJSCoverage(),
  page.coverage.startCSSCoverage()
]);
// Navigate to page
await page.goto('https://example.com');
// Disable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
const [jsCoverage, cssCoverage] = await Promise.all([
  page.coverage.stopJSCoverage(),
  page.coverage.stopCSSCoverage(),
]);
let totalBytes = 0;
let usedBytes = 0;
const coverage = [...jsCoverage, ...cssCoverage];
for (const entry of coverage) {
  totalBytes += entry.text.length;
  for (const range of entry.ranges)
    usedBytes += range.end - range.start - 1;
}
console.log(`Bytes used: ${usedBytes / totalBytes * 100}%`);

```
