## FrameWaitForFunctionOptions.polling property

An interval at which the `pageFunction` is executed, defaults to `raf`. If `polling` is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. If `polling` is a string, then it can be one of the following values:

- `raf` - to constantly execute `pageFunction` in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. This is the tightest polling mode which is suitable to observe styling changes.

- `mutation` - to execute `pageFunction` on every DOM mutation.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
polling?: string | number;
```
