## Page.focus() method

This method fetches an element with `selector` and focuses it. If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
focus(selector: string): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  selector | string | A [selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) of an element to focus. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be focused. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

Promise which resolves when the element matching selector is successfully focused. The promise will be rejected if there is no element matching selector.
