| [AbortError](./puppeteer.aborterror.md)                               | AbortError is emitted whenever certain operations are terminated due to an abort request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Accessibility](./puppeteer.accessibility.md)                         | The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's accessibility tree. The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Browser](./puppeteer.browser.md)                                     | A Browser is created when Puppeteer connects to a Chromium instance, either through [PuppeteerNode.launch()](./puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch.md) or [Puppeteer.connect()](./puppeteer.puppeteer.connect.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [BrowserContext](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md)                       | BrowserContexts provide a way to operate multiple independent browser sessions. When a browser is launched, it has a single BrowserContext used by default. The method [Browser.newPage](./puppeteer.browser.newpage.md) creates a page in the default browser context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
