| [Accessibility](./puppeteer.accessibility.md)       | The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's accessibility tree. The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Browser](./puppeteer.browser.md)                   | A Browser is created when Puppeteer connects to a Chromium instance, either through [PuppeteerNode.launch()](./puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch.md) or [Puppeteer.connect()](./puppeteer.puppeteer.connect.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [BrowserContext](./puppeteer.browsercontext.md)     | BrowserContexts provide a way to operate multiple independent browser sessions. When a browser is launched, it has a single BrowserContext used by default. The method [Browser.newPage](./puppeteer.browser.newpage.md) creates a page in the default browser context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [BrowserFetcher](./puppeteer.browserfetcher.md)     | BrowserFetcher can download and manage different versions of Chromium and Firefox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [CDPSession](./puppeteer.cdpsession.md)             | The <code>CDPSession</code> instances are used to talk raw Chrome Devtools Protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
